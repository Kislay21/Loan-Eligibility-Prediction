# Loan-Eligibility-Prediction- 
Loan Eligibility is defined as a set of criteria basis which a Financial Institutuion access to decide the worthiness of a Customer for a Particular Loan.

In this Project, a predictive model is build to predict if an applicant is eligible for the loan or not. We have used Decision Trees and Naive Bayes Classifier to predict the accuracy of the Model.

For this Project, we have used two Datasets that are Train and Test Datasets. Train Datasets is used for training the Model and developing its Accuracy. It had all the Labels assigned to it. Whereas Test dataset did not had the Predefined Labels. Using the Model that we had build , we had assigned the Class Labels for Test Dataset.
